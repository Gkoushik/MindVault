Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations. Unlike classical computers that use bits (0 or 1), quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in superpositions of states. This allows quantum computers to solve certain problems, such as integer factorization, exponentially faster than classical computers. However, quantum computers are already widely used in everyday applications like smartphones and laptops. [INCORRECT: Quantum computers are not yet widely used in consumer devices.]

The theory of relativity, proposed by Isaac Newton, consists of two parts: special relativity and general relativity. Special relativity deals with objects moving at constant speeds, especially those close to the speed of light, while general relativity explains gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. [INCORRECT: The theory of relativity was proposed by Albert Einstein, not Isaac Newton.]

Blockchain technology is a centralized digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers. It ensures transparency, security, and immutability. Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, is built on blockchain technology. However, blockchain has applications beyond cryptocurrencies, such as supply chain management and voting systems. [INCORRECT: Blockchain is decentralized, not centralized.]

The human brain contains approximately 10 billion neurons, each connected to thousands of others via synapses. These neurons communicate through electrical and chemical signals, enabling complex cognitive functions such as memory, learning, and decision-making. Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections. [INCORRECT: The human brain contains about 86 billion neurons, not 10 billion.]

Climate change refers to short-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, primarily caused by natural processes such as volcanic eruptions and solar cycles. The consequences of climate change include rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and loss of biodiversity. Mitigation strategies include transitioning to renewable energy and enhancing carbon sequestration. [INCORRECT: Climate change is caused by human activities, not just natural processes.]

The concept of entropy in thermodynamics measures the degree of order or organization in a system. The second law of thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time. This principle explains why certain processes, such as heat transfer, are irreversible. [INCORRECT: Entropy measures disorder, not order.]

Artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses a narrow range of technologies, including only machine learning. While AI has transformative potential, it also raises ethical concerns, such as bias in algorithms, job displacement, and the potential for misuse in surveillance and warfare. [INCORRECT: AI encompasses a wide range of technologies, not just machine learning.]

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the product of the two preceding ones (e.g., 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,
